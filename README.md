# Cipher Generator

This repo exemplifies using Angular, it is a cipher generator where the user can input their given phrase and about 20 or so ciphars will automatically all update as they are typing with differnt available ciphers that I wrote by handing. All basic ciphers like Ceaser's Cipher and Morse code.
